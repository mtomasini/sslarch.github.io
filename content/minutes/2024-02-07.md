## Open exchange

- A number of new people attended the meeting: Mathias Bellat, Lisa Steinmann, Julian Laabs, Andrea Titolo
- Various colleagues from France are in the process of creating a national CAA chapter
- Oliver Nakoinz announced that there will be a Mosaic summer school in Kiel 2024. Topic: Handling chronological data
- Zack Batist and Joe Roe shared a preprint about "Collaborative practices in an emerging community of archaeological software engineers": http://zackbatist.info/openarchaeo-collaboration
- Zack Batist applied some major changes to OpenArchaeo and documented them in a blog post: https://blog.zackbatist.info/2024/02/02/pruning-open-archaeo
- Mathias Bellat asked the SSLA community for feedback on a data analysis script: https://github.com/Mathias75018/ML_article
- James Allison reminded us of the SSLA-co-organized EAA session "Applying Archaeological Research Software Engineering as Little Minions: Statistical & Computational Approaches to Daily Archaeological Tasks": https://sslarch.github.io/sessions/eaa2024_session
- Sophie Schmidt made us aware of "tesselle", a collection of R packages for research and teaching in archaeology: https://www.tesselle.org
- Thomas Huet has announced his plan to develop a project based on Python and Jupyter for Google Earth Engine (GEE), using the `ee` library, to manage satellite imagery along with the extensive heritage places from the [EAMENA database](https://eamena.org/database). The goal of this project is to train a Machine Learning model. He encourages community members interested in this initiative to contact him.
