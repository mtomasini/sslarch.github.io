- And one more summer school, the "Venice Summer School in Digital and Public Humanities" (Venice, Italy), as well: https://www.unive.it/pag/39288

## Project discussion

- New SIG SSLA group project about reviving old, archaeological research software
	- Pitches:
		- Lisa Steinmann: Bringing the Quantatools R Package to CRAN
			- Code: https://github.com/maciejkasinski/quantatools and now https://github.com/lsteinmann/quantatools
			- Context: https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10900/101850/CAA2017_Kubicka-Kasinski_The%20Metrological%20Research_OA.pdf
			- State: The author, Maciej Kasi≈Ñski, is not maintaining the project any more and is fine with a fork
		- James Allison: Recovering some core functionality from WinBasp
			- Context: https://baspsoftware.org and https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinBASP
			- State: The author, Irwin Scollar, is not working on the software any more
			- Martin Hinz and Christoph Rinne obtained a copy of the code (16-bit Fortran) at some point in the past
			- Some functionality is already replaced by other tools, e.g. "tosca" (https://martinhinz.shinyapps.io/tosca) for Seriation/Correspondence Analysis or postaar (https://github.com/ISAAKiel/postAAR-python) for the detection of structures in posthole fields
		- James Allison: Tools for quantitative Analysis
			- Context: http://tfqa.com
			- State: The author, Keith Kintigh, may still be working on it. The software has been commercially distributed in the past
			- Joe Roe has started to compile a list of alternative solutions for the individual tools: https://github.com/sslarch/tfqar
			- Matt Peeples has implemented some alternatives: https://mattpeeples.net/data-and-software
		- Martin Hinz: CoinCalc
			- Code: https://github.com/JonatanSiegmund/CoinCalc
			- Context: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0305440317301309
			- Some of the functionality was already been implemented in another package "tapas": https://github.com/JonatanSiegmund/CoinCalc/issues/2, so https://github.com/wfinsinger/tapas
	- See the SIG SSLA chat at https://chat.archaeo.social to see how these ideas are further discussed and developed
	- General questions raised in the discussion:
		- Is it good to provide simple graphical user interfaces, when we as a SIG actually want to encourage the use of scripting languages to ensure computational reproducibilty?
		- Did some of these old tools produce (proprietary?) data formats and would it be valuable to implement conversion tools to transform this data to more modern, open and human- and machine-readable formats?

## Next SIG Meeting: Wednesday, May 8, 2024

We invited Nicolas Frerebeau to introduce the tesselle R package collection: https://www.tesselle.org
