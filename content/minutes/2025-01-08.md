## CAA2025 conference

- The conference program is still unclear, but is currently announced to extend over five days (5-9 May)!

## Ideas/Plans for the SIG in 2025

- Invited talks by Shawn Graham (already invited, needs scheduling) and Emily Coco (Sébastien Plutniak offered to ask her)
- Proposal by James Allison: Work committedly on the TFQAR project and present the progress in a session at CAA2026? Maybe with a focus on spatial data analysis.
- Bridge our Mastodon account to Bluesky and be more visible on social media: https://archaeo.social/@CAA_SSLA
- A new survey to optimize our meeting time (will be announced separately)
