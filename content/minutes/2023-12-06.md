# Open exchange

## conference

- some of us participated in Jena Big Historical Data conference (https://bhdc.earth/): it was good, main topic was the analysis of big data

- ONLINE 11th-12th December: Barcelona workshop: Social modelling and simulations: https://heuristica.participa.cloud/conferences/SMSBarcelona2023
- free
- open online debate space for until 10th December, log in and give your opinion

- ArchaeFOSS takes placec next week: https://www.archeofoss.org/2023/
  - panel by Joe Roe and Zack Baptist on Social Media and Fediverse in archaeology

## various

- new: topic of dark data: unused data in databases, usually 60% in a database

- the archaeoanalyst by Shawn Graham: https://archaeo.social/@electricarchaeo@scholar.social/111410944058988315 and https://electricarchaeology.ca/2023/11/07/using-gpt4-turbo-to-extract-relationships-and-entities-with-the-llm-python-package/
  - Large Language Model to analyse archaeological data (stratigraphy to Harris Matrix)

# archaeo-riddle https://theia.arch.cam.ac.uk/archaeoriddle/
- talk by Alfredo, Simon and Ismael

- Enrico R. Crema und Xavier Rubico-Castillo conceptualised the project
- simulate archaeological data for analysis of others ->  test archaeological methods and hypotheses, which is usually not possible in archaeology
- 6 proposals of ppl trying to answer the questions at the EAA conference

## modelling process
- world "rabbithole"
  - elevation map generated through Perlin noise
  - sites of two different groups (farmers and hunter-gatherers) generated on parameters like nearness to water
  - archaeological record generated by population dynamics models
  + loss of the record (short term and long-term)
  - a lot of sites disappeared, lost evidence etc
  --> record of each site is generated independently

  - behavioural model:
  - meeting between two groups simulated on nearness and population size -> leapfrog or fight
  - population growth was modeled (fighting makes the growth values a bit smaller than "usual" growth)
  - dispersal speed via sea crossing faster than via land

## game idea

- extract coordinates from sites, and 30 radiocarbon dates of the site + affiliation of site
- data availability
  - map gridded in 100 grids
  - participants got info in CSV files of all the same 5 grids of the map, and then chose 5 further to get more information
  - already different ways researchers chose the further 5 grids -- sampling method!

- researchers were given 3 main questions: relationship between the groups, population tajectories and rates of dispersal?
- people analysed their data and prepared answers for EAA 2023

## plans
- will be sharing their data and describe the code via Bookdown
- there will be a poll on methodology and participation
- collective thoughts on how to improve archaeological methods
- collective publications

## Questions/ Discussion
- models and all code is in R, because most analyses are done in R (14C dates etc) --> stays consistent
- Agent Based Modelling is possible in R

- 14C dates were taken as "real world" 7500 calBC data

- parameters for loss of data etc were eyeballed, but reasonably, so that the outcome looked more or less realistic
- in some cases it was well thought out on population movement of rather younger people, dietary ideas etc
- many models were created --> "explorative method"

- data given to participants: no archaeological types, but affiliations to hunter-gatherers and farmers?
  - would have been to complicated to include types at this point

- comment: arcmatnet (https://peerj.com/articles/cs-1419/) might be a sensible extension (model for style / transfer)


- what happens if you don't have 10/100 squares, but if you have all the data?
  - there is now the possibility to re-sample the data and run it through the 5 methods people have used and check what would change based on sampling
  - it would be interesting to check the generation bias and to compare analysis of the wholeness of data before loss and all the data after loss

- how accurate were the colleagues in their results?
  - it was just a 15 min of results presentation at EAA, so not too much information yet
  - very impressive: all got the rough strokes "correctly", like the war between the two groups
  - not the aim to put people in competition, but analyse the approaches, needs to be respectful
  - still needs work to put all this together
  - every participant used the methods they knew - so this is interesting, that we don't chose methods regarding the question but what we know already
    - one researcher used a non-mathematical approach, someone used a ABM, spatial distribution modelling, ... a variety of methods used


- data set is useful for teaching
  - has already been used by members of SIG SSLA

- model will be re-worked and improved
  - is the world re-createable? seed set in the model was forgotten, but all the parameters are fixed (will be remembered in the next version)
  - could be used as a bench mark dataset for different methods


- comment on the project: a great approach and a groundbreaking idea for checking our disciplines methods
