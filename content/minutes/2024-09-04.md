## Invited talk

Nicolas Frerebeau introduced the tesselle R package suite, an integrated set of packages for various archaeological research applications: https://www.tesselle.org

Some of the questions that were raised in the discussion:

- How to measure the impact of an R package?
	- Nicolas has published multiple papers on individual tesselle packages (e.g. https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.01821) and he can observe the number of citations.
	- He recommends adding a CITATION.cff file to each repository: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-citation-files
	- Zack Batist suggested to use the GitHub search to find R code loading a given package: https://github.com/search?q=library%28kairos%29&type=code
- How to apply for funding for scientific software projects?
	- We decided to compile some resources about this question, first in a discussion thread on GitHub, later potentially on the SSLArch website: https://github.com/orgs/sslarch/discussions/52
- Is it better to split a set of entangled R packages (or generally libraries/modules for any programming language) over many repos, or keep them together in a large monorepo?
	- This has been extensively discussed by software developers. Both approaches come with their own advantages and disadvantages.
- Which licences should be used for archaeological research software?
	- https://choosealicense.com
	- Restrictive licenses may discourage adoption in the commercial archaeology sector.
	- Funding institutions may consider software licensing more explicitly in the future (see UK).

## SIG-SSLA Projects

- Project: Reviving the "Tools for quantitative analysis" (https://github.com/sslarch/tfqar)
	- We decided to adopt the GitHub discussion forum for some general exchange: https://github.com/sslarch/tfqar/discussions
- Project: Session for CAA2025
	- Martin Hinz and Clemens Schmid have started to work on an abstract about programming interfaces (APIs, CLIs, DSLs - Domain specific languages) in archaeology.
	- The google docs link was shared in the matrix chat, interested group members are invited to join the session organisation.

## Next SIG Meeting: Wednesday, October 2, 2024
